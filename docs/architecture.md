# Architecture

The bootstrap now uses a source-of-truth plus generated-target layout.

## Source Directories

- `shared/policies/`: reusable workflow, quality, code, testing, routing, and deployment guidance.
- `shared/skills/`: reusable skills with `visibility: public|background` metadata.
- `shared/hooks/`: hook config and guardrail scripts.
- `shared/devcontainer/`: GPU devcontainer bootloader and Hugging Face AI state sync helper. The `Dockerfile` uses a two-stage build: Node.js 22 binaries are copied from `node:22-bookworm-slim` into the NVIDIA CUDA DL base image (Ubuntu ships Node 18, which is too old for `context-mode`). `bubblewrap` and `context-mode` are installed so hook events work inside the container. `--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN` and `--security-opt=seccomp=unconfined` are required for bubblewrap namespace creation inside Docker. The `Dockerfile` also handles pre-existing GID/UID 1000 conflicts (GID guard by numeric ID; user rename via `usermod`/`groupmod` when UID is already taken). The devcontainer bind-mounts `~/.cache/huggingface` from the host so cached credentials and models are available without re-authenticating inside the container.
- `shared/mcp/servers.yaml`: single MCP server definition for Semble and context-mode.
- `shared/agents/`: canonical custom-agent metadata and neutral prompts.
- `shared/review-profiles/`: checklists consumed by the unified `reviewer` agent.
- `shared/prompts/`: reusable prompt templates.
- `shared/templates/`, `shared/scripts/`, `shared/MEMORY.md`, and state README directories: source inputs rendered into the shared `.claude/` basis.
- `shared/schemas/`: schema documentation for shared metadata.

## Generated Target

The single installable output is `dist/multi-agent/`.

It includes a trackable `.devcontainer/` GPU sandbox plus the `.claude/` shared basis for skills, instructions, review profiles, canonical agent bodies, prompts, memory, plans, explorations, session logs, quality reports, templates, quality scoring, and hook scripts. Native files outside `.claude/` are thin adapters or runtime config for GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and OpenAI Codex.

Do not edit `dist/` manually. Regenerate it with:

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_targets.py --all
```

## Hook Dispatcher

All hook commands route through `shared/hooks/scripts/run-hook.sh` rather than calling guardrail scripts directly. The dispatcher resolves `REPO_ROOT` in order:

1. `BASH_SOURCE[0]` relative navigation (primary — works when the script is called by path)
2. Environment variable fallbacks: `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, `WORKSPACE_FOLDER`, `VSCODE_CWD`, `PWD`
3. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` from the current directory

This fixes two real failure modes found in consumer repos:

- `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` being empty in Claude Code, producing paths like `/.claude/hooks/scripts/...`
- `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)` resolving to a different directory than the repo root when invoked from certain working directories

The generated hook configs for all three tools use the pattern:

```bash
REPO_ROOT="<root-expr>"; "$REPO_ROOT/.claude/hooks/scripts/run-hook.sh" <script> [args...]
```

Hook errors (from `hf-ai-sync.sh` and others) are written to `.claude/session_logs/hooks-errors.log` in addition to stderr, so failures are auditable after the fact.

## Custom Agents

Custom agents are source-controlled under `shared/agents/<agent-id>/`.

Each agent contains:

- `agent.yaml`: stable metadata, capabilities, visibility, delegates, and model intent.
- `prompt.md`: target-neutral behavior.

The generator derives Copilot, Claude Code, and Codex adapters from those two files. Copilot model fields are target bindings, not portable semantics. GitHub Copilot agent `model` fields must be a single supported Copilot model string. Claude and Codex adapters must not include Copilot model pins. Codex agents are generated as project-scoped `.codex/agents/*.toml` adapters that point to `.claude/agents/`. Codex skills are generated under `.claude/skills/` and wired through `[[skills.config]]` entries in `.codex/config.toml`.
