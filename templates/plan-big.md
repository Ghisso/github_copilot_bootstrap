# Big Plan: <slug>

## Context

[Why this work exists]

## Goals

- [Goal]

## Design Overview

[High-level design]

## Phases

- [ ] `<small-plan-slug-1>`
- [ ] `<small-plan-slug-2>`

## Verification

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_targets.py --all
uv run python scripts/validate_targets.py
uv run python scripts/check_runtime.py
```

## Completion Evidence

The final phase listed under `phases:` must also run a documentation,
memory, and LEARN audit: sweep every live-advice surface for claims this plan
or earlier work invalidated, correct or supersede each one, leave dated
records (archived plans, dated design narratives, closed session logs)
unchanged, and record the audited surfaces and each one's outcome under a
`## Stale-claims surfaces checked` heading in that phase's closeout session
log. `verify.py`'s closeout gate requires that exact heading, non-empty,
whenever the phase it is closing out is this list's last entry.
