## Scope

[What this phase changes]

## Steps

- [ ] [Step]

## Verification

<!-- Every non-comment line in a `bash`/`sh` block below is a required item:
     a shell command `verify closeout` runs itself, from the repository
     root, and that must exit 0. Never list `verify.py closeout` itself.
     Anything a script cannot run — an interactive probe, a host session, a
     manual inspection — belongs under `## Optional Verification` instead.
     See the Verification Evidence Contract in
     `shared/policies/workflow.instructions.md`. -->

```bash
uv run python .claude/scripts/verify.py fast --format json               # during IMPLEMENT
```

## Optional Verification

<!-- The only place a check may be conditional or non-executable. One `- `
     bullet per item, numbered in the order it appears. -->

- [Optional check]

## Closeout Checklist

Follow the fixed closeout order in `shared/policies/workflow.instructions.md`
(Canonical Orchestrator Loop, step 5: CLOSEOUT); the order below mirrors it
rather than restating it.

- [ ] Documentation updated or explicitly skipped as pure-internal
- [ ] LEARN entries saved or no-lessons marker recorded
- [ ] Closeout session log has `**Status:** COMPLETED`
- [ ] Nested plan state checkpointed (`.claude` ai-state) before staging outer-repository files
- [ ] Intended outer files explicitly staged and `git diff --cached` reviewed
- [ ] Every surviving MINOR has an explicit disposition and non-empty reason
- [ ] Review findings resolved and persisted with branch/phase metadata
- [ ] Verification passed (`verify phase` PASS; `verify closeout` runs the plan's required verification items itself and PASS)

## Pause Checkpoint

Use only after the user explicitly asks to stop or checkpoint and resume later.
Set `status: paused`, record the three pause fields, and create a session log
with `**Status:** PAUSED`. A checkpoint commit preserves incomplete work; it
does not require final findings, LEARN, DOCUMENT, or a completed closeout.
After the checkpoint commit, it may be pushed as a durable remote backup when
paused-publication invariants pass. It remains unfinished and blocks PR creation
and final closeout.
Keep the big plan `in-progress` with the same `current_phase`. On resume, read
the pause log and Git state, restore this plan to `in-progress`, and continue
this same phase without creating another small plan.
