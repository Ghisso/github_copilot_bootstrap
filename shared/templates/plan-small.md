## Closeout Checklist

Follow the fixed closeout order in `shared/policies/workflow.instructions.md`
(Canonical Orchestrator Loop, step 5: CLOSEOUT); the order below mirrors it
rather than restating it.

- [ ] Documentation updated or explicitly skipped as pure-internal
- [ ] LEARN entries saved or no-lessons marker recorded
- [ ] Closeout session log has `**Status:** COMPLETED`
- [ ] Nested plan state checkpointed (`.claude` ai-state) before staging outer-repository files
- [ ] Intended outer files explicitly staged and `git diff --cached` reviewed
- [ ] Every surviving MINOR has an explicit disposition and non-empty reason
- [ ] Review findings resolved and persisted with branch/phase metadata
- [ ] Verification passed (`verify phase` then `verify closeout` PASS)

## Pause Checkpoint

Use only after the user explicitly asks to stop or checkpoint and resume later.
Set `status: paused`, record the three pause fields, and create a session log
with `**Status:** PAUSED`. A checkpoint commit preserves incomplete work; it
does not require final findings, LEARN, DOCUMENT, or a completed closeout.
After the checkpoint commit, it may be pushed as a durable remote backup when
paused-publication invariants pass. It remains unfinished and blocks PR creation
and final closeout.
Keep the big plan `in-progress` with the same `current_phase`. On resume, read
the pause log and Git state, restore this plan to `in-progress`, and continue
this same phase without creating another small plan.
